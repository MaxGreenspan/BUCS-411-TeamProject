When everything is good:
A user opens our web app, and that user will be able to see a search bar in the middle.
The user types one keyword, and then the user will see a quote related with this keyword.
Also, the user will see a related image as a background. There will be a centered text, that is the quote.
Below the quote, it should be a button called "view image". That will open a page with only the picture.
