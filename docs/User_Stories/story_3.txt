A user wants to search something. But before the user inputs something, the user mistyped some random characters in the search bar.
Now, the keyword is no longer a valid english word.
In this situation, if the service cannot understand the word, the user sees something like:
"Sorry, but this word is invalid. Try inputting a different word!"
The user goes back and does a normal search.
Then refer to story_1.
