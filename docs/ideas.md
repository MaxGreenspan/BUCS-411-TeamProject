Ideas:

1. A quote generator:

We will do a quote generator.
The core objective of this initiative is to create a user-friendly web platform that caters to users seeking
motivational or meaningful content personalized to their interest.
Users can input specific keywords into the system, which then
generates a relevant quote and a corresponding image.
The resulting combinations can serve as a source of inspiration, motivation, or reflection for users

2. A dashboard: widget:

The chrome default page is not doing too many things. If we can have a toolbox that have everything in handy,It would be
great.
If we have this thing, we can save a lot of time by going to this app as the only place to start working for today.

3. A receipe generator:

Based on what is in our fridge, do you want to know what you can make out of it? If we have this app, then it is
possible that
we utilize everything left in your fridge, while still being able to cook a delicious meal!
